The main purpose of this app is to help cyclists optimize their biking routine

and performance. This is done through three different machine learning models: 

A Bike Route optimzier, Cycling Performance Tracker and a Weather-based 

riding recommender system. 

**Features/Components of the App:**

- **Bike Route Optimization**
    - Safe, efficient and personalized routes
    - ML-driven route analysis(safety, distance, elevation)
    - Interactive map integration
    - User preferences for route selection(safety vs speed vs terrain)
- **Cycling Performance Tracker**
    - Ride data management(distance, time, speed, elevation)
    - Data visualization(charts and graphs)
        - Possible technolgoies: Pandas, Scikit-learn
    - Predictive analytics for performance improvement
    - Personalized training recommendations
        - Possible technologies: OpenAI/Google Gemini API
- **Weather-based riding recommendations**
    - Real-time weather forecasting
    - Optimal time riding suggestions
    - Weather condition alerts(rain, wind, extreme temperatures)
    - ML-driven predictive insights for optimal cycling conditions

**Choosing the Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**
    - Possible frameworks: React js, Angular js, Vue js, Next js
        - **React**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Component based, Virtual DOM improves responsiveness, Server side rendering capability with Next js, Vast ecosystem w/ community support, good for scalable applications
            - **Disadvs**: Many tools needed for larger apps(ie. state management, routing, etc)
        - **Next js**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Built in server side rendering, file-based routing, easier project setup, improved SEO and faster load times
            - **Disadvs**: Less flexible structure than pure React
        - **Angular**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Complete built in toolkit(routing, state manag. , HTTP, etc), Structured approach and clear architecture
            - **Disadvs**: Less flexible structure, Performance overhead
        - **Vue**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Flexible integration, lightweight framework, offers balance between React and Angular
            - **Disadvs**: Less community & support, Not ideal for scalable apps without additional tools
    - Why React is the best option for this app:
        - Strong ecosystem for support and Libraries(ie. Map APIs), Axios and ML API Connections
        - Component Modularity: Lots of individual components within the app(ie. interactive maps, user input forms, graphs, etc), enhancing maintanability and performance
        - Great Performance: Virtual DOM updates important for interactive mapping
    - Possible tradeoffs with React:
        - Requires manual setup for React router, state management, style frameworks
        - Weaker SEO Performance without Next js
            - Not crucial for this app however
- Backend
    - Possible frameworks: Node/Express js, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails
        - **Node/Express js**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Full stack Javascript ecosystem simplifies development, fast and scalable, large number of packages via npm, perfect for interactive features
            - **Disadvs**: Requires careful handling of asynchronous operations, can require maunal setup and additional middleware packages, CPU-intensive tasks require careful handling
        - **Flask**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Minimalist structure, fast development for small-medium APIs, Strong integration with DS/ML apps, lightweight/efficient
            - **Disadvs**: Manual setup for larger application(unopiniated framework), concerns for scalability(better for small-scale apps)
        - **Django**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Built in features(ie. ORM, authentication, routing, etc), strong built-in security practices, Machine Learning friendly
            - **Disadvs**:  Harder to deviate from patterns(opinionated framework), overkill for simple APIs, harder initial setup
        - **Ruby on Rails**: Advantages/Disadvantages
            - **Advs**: Rapid prototyping and consistent architecture, mature and stable ecosystem, fast, enjoyable coding experience
            - **Disadvs**: Heavier and weaker performance under high load, limited flexibility due to strict conventions, poorer ML integration
    - **Why Node/Express js is the best option for this app**:
        - Ideal for interactive features, live updates, performance tracking, et
        - Seamless integration with React frontend improving productivity, event driven architecture handles concurrent requests efficiently
        - Can utilize REST APIs to easily integrate ML endpoints
    - **Possible tradeoffs with Node/Express js**:
        - Isn’t ideal for CPU-intensive tasks
            - Using Python’s Fast API will help mitigate this issue
        - Requires selecting additional middleware, libraries and structure manually compared to Django or Ruby on Rails
        - Requires clear coding patterns to handle asynchronous operations effectively
            - Strong use of async/await Promises helps mitigate this issue
