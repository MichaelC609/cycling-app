The main purpose of this app is to help cyclists optimize their biking routine

and performance. This is done through three different machine learning models: 

A Bike Route optimzier, Cycling Performance Tracker and a Weather-based 

riding recommender system.

    - Interactive map integration
    - User preferences for route selection(safety vs speed vs terrain)
- **Cycling Performance Tracker**
    - Ride data management(distance, time, speed, elevation)
    - Data visualization(charts and graphs)
        - Possible technolgoies: Pandas, Scikit-learn
    - Predictive analytics for performance improvement
    - Personalized training recommendations
        - Possible technologies: OpenAI/Google Gemini API
- **Weather-based riding recommendations**
    - Real-time weather forecasting
    - Optimal time riding suggestions
    - Weather condition alerts(rain, wind, extreme temperatures)
    - ML-driven predictive insights for optimal cycling conditions
